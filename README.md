This repository contains an example of a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero. The `bug.ada` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a solution that handles the exception gracefully.  The error is a classic example of how runtime exceptions can disrupt program flow. Ada's exception handling mechanism is demonstrated as a means to mitigate this type of error.
